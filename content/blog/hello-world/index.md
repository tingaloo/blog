I know, I know, I am as excited as you guys. My guest list was apparently the whole world and Matty M. And I'm 99.9999999% sure that only .00000001% will even bother showing up. That .00000001% may or may not contain Matty M.

## Question: Will Matty M show up?

He probably will. after all I promised to attend his book signing INSERT LINK. I was inspired to write this blog when he announced he was(is) in process of writing his book. You heard it here first, a nonfiction novel based on healthcare and artifical intelligence. Well then.

So what's next? Do we keep celebrating? Do I keep hyping Matty M? Is this blog post an advertisement for a book that does not even exist? Am I just a shill and literally writing about nothing? Am I generating pre order interest for Matty M? What are we even doing right now, wasn't this blog supposed to be about me?

## I have no idea.

Maybe this blog will it to the preface of Matty M's book. And I will get a small sliver of recognition that means nothing. That is to be determined. What I do know is that you will have read this post.
