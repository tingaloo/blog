## Background?

We need to eat, and we need to stay healthy. Why not automate the production of a healthy snack?


## CI/CD What?

Milk Kefir is an easy yogurt to make in the office. It can be tangy, sugarfree, and grow erratically. It sits quietly on the counter and needs feeding once in a while.

Luckily we can make a strain of yogurt everyday!

Ingredients
```
Milk Kefir
Gallon of Milk
4x Quart Jar
```

## CI / CD Pipeline

Requirements:
1. The milk kefir can be consumed at any given moment.
