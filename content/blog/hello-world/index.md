I know, I know, I am as excited as you guys. My guest list was apparently the whole world and Matty M. And I'm 99.9999999% sure that only .00000001% will even bother showing up. That .00000001% may or may not contain Matty M.

## Question: Will [Matty M](https://www.linkedin.com/in/matthewmarcetich/) show up?

## Well look who it is

Matty M: Hey Lew!

Me: Hey Matt! I'm glad you showed up.

Matty M: Thanks Lew!

Me: How was your weekend?

Matty M: Pretty good.


See, [I promised](https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:6569610676472549376?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A6569610676472549376%2C6570848775005356032%29) to attend his book signing. So it only makes sense he showed up for my first blog post. Maybe he doesn't realize it yet, but the inspiration behind this blog came from somewhere. Perhaps he already knows, or perhaps he is too busy gathering primary sources for his book. In the spirit of this first blog post.

## Let's give it up for Matty M ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹ðŸ‘‹

So what's next? Do we keep celebrating? Do I keep hyping Matty M? Is this blog post an advertisement to generate interest? Am I just a shill? Am I preemptively doing what all insecure authors do by talking about other's accomplishments? Am I going to get a cut from Matty M's book sales? What are we even doing right now, wasn't this blog supposed to be about me?

## I have no idea.

Maybe this blog will be referenced in Matty M's book. Content creators need to stick together. 

## Glad you stopped on by.
