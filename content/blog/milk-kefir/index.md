## Background?

Healthy is good. Milk is good. Yogurt comes from milk, which is also good. Milk kefir is just a better strain.


## Why not just buy yogurt? 

Buying yogurt means we failed to implement a CI/CD pipeline. Buying yogurt means we do not have faith in raising our own yogurt cultures. Buying yogurt means we do not believe in our ability to ferment products.

## Why not just make traditional yogurt?

Traditional yogurt tastes good, but requires heating the milk up to 180F. That requires a stove or microwave, and the assumption is we just cannot afford those expensive appliances. Traditional yogurt needs milk to be scalded. Milk kefir does not need scalding, it will eat that milk. Just like how I will drink a quart of milk kefir.
