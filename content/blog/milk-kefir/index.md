Milk Kefir is one of those things that just won't die.
Luckily we can make a strain of yogurt everyday!

Ingredients
```
Milk Kefir Grains
Gallon of Milk
2x Quart Jar
```

I get my grains from the [Kombucha and Culture share](https://www.facebook.com/groups/ProbioticCultures/) Facebook group. It's best to find the grains locally.

Once they arrive, immediately dump them in some milk. The first couple batches will probably be off because they are shocked from the transportation and the mail service.

And then we get to feeding!

Consume one quart while the other quart continues to grow.
Stall MK growth by placing it in the fridge, do this too long and you'll need to refresh them with some fresh milk.
