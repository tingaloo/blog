## What is office Kombucha?

What is an heirloom kombucha SCOBY? What is an tibetan kombucha scoby? I don't know exactly. But my kombucha is brewed right there in the office.

## Won't it stink up the whole office?

Depends on who you ask. 

## I'm sold, how do I make it?

Ingredients:
```
1. Store bought GT Kombucha
2. Office tea Bags
3. Office sugar
4. Office Interns
5. Gallon pickle jars
6. Office
```

## I got em, what's next?

Here's a [secret recipe](https://www.reddit.com/r/Kombucha/comments/5b1ztm/reddit_master_kombucha_recipe/) courtesy of /u/Balsamicon.
